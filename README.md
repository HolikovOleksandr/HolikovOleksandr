ðŸ’¡ Hello! I'm a junior backend developer use JavaScript and TypeScript. Although I've been coding for over a year, my experience in these languages is relatively recent, as I was previously actively involved in developing mobile applications using Flutter and working on backend with C# (ASP.NET).

ðŸ“š This shift from mobile development and C# to JavaScript and TypeScript is an exciting new path for me. I'm always open to learning new technologies and constantly expanding my tech stack.

ðŸ¤– Additionally, the satisfaction I derive from creating Telegram bots in JavaScript is akin to the joy I experienced in developing mobile apps and backend systems.

ðŸŒ± I'm excited to embark on this new journey in the world of JavaScript and TypeScript and am always open to new challenges and collaboration on interesting projects!
